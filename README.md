## [About Us:](https://hts-tech-team.github.io/about)
- We are a group of students ranging from the ages of 13 - 18.

- We are very capable of running small shows, to full on productions. As we are students, we show the younger members of the team the ropes. This ensures our services are always available to the people who require them. This also gives the young people of today the experience of having a job, and learning things that they would have otherwise not have had the opportunity to learn.
